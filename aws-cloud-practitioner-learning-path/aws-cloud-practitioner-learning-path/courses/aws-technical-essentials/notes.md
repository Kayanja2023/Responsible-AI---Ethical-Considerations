# AWS Technical Essentials  
**Duration:** 4 hours  
**Course Format:** Digital Training  
**Platform:** AWS Skill Builder  
**Certification Track:** AWS Foundational â€“ Technical Readiness  

## 1. Course Overview

The *AWS Technical Essentials* course introduces core AWS infrastructure services, their configuration and use, and foundational system integration strategies. This course is designed for professionals who require a working knowledge of AWS services and tools to make informed technical decisions.

For a Research and Development Engineer, this course supports cloud readiness across project prototyping, architectural experimentation, and cloud-native solution delivery.

## 2. Course Objectives

Upon completion of this course, learners are expected to:

- Understand the AWS global infrastructure and deployment architecture.
- Launch, configure, and manage AWS compute, storage, and networking services.
- Apply basic security and identity policies via AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
- Monitor resources with AWS-native observability tools.
- Interpret and plan resource deployments with a systems-level perspective.

## 3. Core Concepts and Services

### 3.1 AWS Global Infrastructure

- **Regions and Availability Zones (AZs):** Geographic redundancy and fault-tolerant design.
- **Edge Locations:** Content delivery via CloudFront and Lambda@Edge.
- **VPC Endpoints & Direct Connect:** Private access and hybrid network configurations.

### 3.2 Compute Services

| Service        | Description                                 | Use Case                                        |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Amazon EC2     | Scalable virtual machines                   | General-purpose applications, dev/test workloads |
| EC2 Auto Scaling | Scale EC2 resources based on demand         | Load-responsive elasticity                      |
| Elastic Load Balancing | Distributes network traffic across instances | High availability                              |
| AWS Lambda     | Serverless function execution               | Event-driven tasks, microservices               |

### 3.3 Storage Services

| Service        | Description                                 | Use Case                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Amazon S3      | Object storage with high durability         | Data lakes, backups, application assets  |
| Amazon EBS     | Block storage for EC2                       | OS volumes, file systems, databases      |
| Amazon EFS     | NFS-based file storage                      | Shared workloads, Linux-based deployments|

### 3.4 Networking Services

- **Amazon VPC:** Logical isolation of cloud infrastructure.
- **Subnets, Route Tables, NAT Gateways:** Core elements of internal and external routing.
- **Security Groups vs. NACLs:** Stateful vs. stateless traffic controls.
- **Elastic IPs:** Static IP for dynamic cloud resources.

### 3.5 Identity and Access Management (IAM)

- Role-based access control with fine-grained policy assignment.
- IAM roles for services vs. IAM users for human operators.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and policy boundaries.

### 3.6 Monitoring and Governance

- **Amazon CloudWatch:** Metrics, alarms, dashboards for performance monitoring.
- **AWS CloudTrail:** Governance and compliance through activity logging.
- **AWS Config:** Resource state auditing and compliance snapshots.

## 4. Hands-On Exercises

The course included guided labs involving:

- Launching EC2 instances and attaching storage.
- Creating and applying IAM policies to users and roles.
- Configuring a VPC with custom subnets and internet gateways.
- Monitoring resource metrics via CloudWatch dashboards.

These labs simulated real deployment environments and served to reinforce both configuration fluency and architectural reasoning.

## 5. Reflections and R&D Relevance

This course established critical technical fluency necessary for:

- Developing cloud-native R&D workflows with minimal operational overhead.
- Understanding the trade-offs between compute models (EC2 vs. Lambda).
- Designing secure, cost-aware environments for iterative development.
- Collaborating effectively with cloud operations and DevSecOps teams.

The direct engagement with service configuration and infrastructure design supports a research-led approach to prototyping and architectural proof-of-concept work.
