## 2. Course Objectives

The course is structured to help learners:

- Define cloud computing and identify key characteristics of cloud environments.
- Understand the AWS global infrastructure and its importance in application delivery.
- Describe basic AWS service categories including compute, storage, and networking.
- Recognize the cost-efficiency, elasticity, and reliability benefits of cloud platforms.

## 3. Core Topics and Concepts

### 3.1 Introduction to Cloud Computing

- **Definition:** Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - On-demand self-service
  - Broad network access
  - Resource pooling
  - Rapid elasticity
  - Measured service

### 3.2 Why AWS?

- **Market Leadership:** AWS is the most mature and widely adopted cloud platform, trusted by governments, startups, and enterprises.
- **Security:** End-to-end security model including encryption, identity management, and compliance frameworks.
- **Global Reach:** Extensive infrastructure with multiple AWS Regions and Availability Zones ensures low-latency and disaster-resilient deployments.

### 3.3 Service Categories (High-Level)

| Category    | Service Example | Functionality                              |
|-------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Compute     | Amazon EC2       | Virtual server provisioning                |
| Storage     | Amazon S3        | Secure, scalable object storage            |
| Databases   | Amazon RDS       | Managed relational database                |
| Networking  | Amazon VPC       | Logical network isolation and routing      |
| Identity    | AWS IAM          | Access management and resource control     |

### 3.4 Cost and Performance Benefits

- **Cost-Efficiency:** Transition from capital-intensive infrastructure to a flexible, consumption-based model.
- **Scalability:** Infrastructure can expand or contract based on workload needs, supporting variable research or usage scenarios.
- **Agility:** Faster time-to-deployment, facilitating rapid innovation cycles.

## 4. Relevance to Research and Development

This course establishes conceptual readiness to:

- Interpret and evaluate cloud readiness for new R&D initiatives.
- Communicate with stakeholders across business and engineering functions using accurate cloud terminology.
- Identify which AWS service domains are best suited to support experimentation, simulation, and digital product delivery.

It emphasizes cloud fluency as a prerequisite to deeper architectural work and aligns with industry-standard language and thinking around modern infrastructure.
